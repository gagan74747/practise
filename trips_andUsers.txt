(select b.request_at,count(*) as count from
 (select g.*,h.banned as isdriverBanned from
  (select t.*,u.banned as isUserBanned ,u.role from trips t join users u on t.client_id = u.users_id ) as g
  JOIN users h on g.driver_id = h.users_id) as b where b.status != 'completed' AND b.isuserbanned != 'Yes' AND b.isdriverbanned != 'Yes'    group by    request_at)
  as d
  full OUTER JOIN 
  (select b.request_at,count(*) as count from(select g.*,h.banned as isdriverBanned from
																   (select t.*,u.banned as isUserBanned ,u.role from trips t join users u on t.client_id = u.users_id ) as g JOIN users h on g.driver_id = h.users_id) as b where b.isuserbanned != 'Yes' AND b.isdriverbanned != 'Yes'    group by    request_at)  
  
 as w
																   on d.request_at=w.request_at) as foo)as meow ;
